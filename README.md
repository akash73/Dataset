# Dataset
Repo for keeping track of public useful dataset 
As I have a really bad memory, this repo is just for documenting interesting public dataset I've used or found.

This dataset comes from [this interesting paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2021.779587/full) on anomaly detection of devices based on power consumption
